  GitHub provides distributed version controls geared towards tracking and managing changes to software code.<br>
    In line with this, several developers can work on a Git repository and track changes along the way.<br>
    Further, every team member can access the database simultaneously to view previous versions.
  <li><b></b>Purpose of github:</b></li>
  GitHub, meanwhile, serves as a host for
    Git repository teams to store their code in a centralized location.<br>
    While Git is a tool that's used 
    to manage multiple versions of source code edits that are then transferred to files in a Git repository, GitHub serves as a location for uploading copies of a Git repository.</ul>
